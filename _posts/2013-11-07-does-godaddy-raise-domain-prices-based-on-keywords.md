    Is GoDaddy Selectively Raising Domain Prices?
  </p>
</div>

GoDaddy wanted me to pay $200 to register a domain. Know that the domain was not already registered, I went to NameCheap and registered it for the normal amount.

Does GoDaddy raise the price of domains based on certain keywords? That makes me uncomfortable shopping with them.
