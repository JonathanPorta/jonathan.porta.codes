While I was setting up <a title="My Youtube Channel" href="http://youtube.com/user/rurd4me" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>, I wanted to create some sort of graphic for the channel art.

YouTube provides a <a title="YouTube Channel Art Sizing Explanation" href="http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&topic=16630&ctx=topic&answer=2972003" target="_blank">great explanation</a> of the sizes for different devices but I found myself recreating the guides in Photoshop when I was working on my channel art graphic.

I ended up with a pretty hastily made template that mimics the provided template graphic, except it is a Photoshop CS5 file with layers, just like an onion.

<div id="attachment_110" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 660px">
  <a href="/images/posts/2013/04/youtube-channel-art-template.png" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-110" title="My Youtube Channel Art Template as a PNG Small" src="/images/posts/2013/04/youtube-channel-art-template-small.png" alt="My Youtube Channel Art Template as a PNG Small" width="650" height="366" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    Click for full-size PNG
  </p>
</div>

Just in case this could be helpful, here are the downloads for the full size PNG guides and the Photoshop file I ended up with.
