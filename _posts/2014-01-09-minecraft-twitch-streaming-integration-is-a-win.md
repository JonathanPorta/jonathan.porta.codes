I finally had a chance to checkout the new Twitch integration in Minecraft 1.7.4 and I was amazed at how easy it was to get started.

I was up and streaming within a few minutes.

All I had to do was login to my Minecraft account and connect it to my Twitch account. I did have to restart Minecraft because the streaming settings didn&#8217;t appear at first. Other than that, no issues. Just hit F6 and you&#8217;re live.

It was nothing fancy, but, here is a recording of the stream:
