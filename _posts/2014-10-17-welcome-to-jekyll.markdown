### Hello? Is this thing on? Good.
I have been wanting to switch my blog off of Wordpress and over to Jekyll for a very long time. Well, I finally did it.

### Why I Ditched self-hosted Wordpress
I was running a self-hosted installation of Wordpress. It was slow, hard to change and just felt way too heavy for what I needed.
I write posts rather infrequently. In fact, I suck at writing new posts and will use any excuse in the world to not write one and a self-hosted Wordpress installation gave me lots of excuses not to write.
For one, it seemed like anytime I would login to write up a post I would be told that I needed to update. Updating involves me logging into cPanel, finding phpMyAdmin and making a backup.
Then, I would need to fight with Wordpress to update, and finally, I could start writing. I know that I don't need to update, but since I don't really follow the stuff that happens in the
Wordpress community, I have no idea whether I am loeaving myself open to hundreds of zero-day exploits or just missing out on a sexier admin interace. Everytime I would go through this process I would think to myself "Damn, I just want to open up my editor and write out my post."
Well, that's what Jekyll lets me do!

### Jekyll: Open your Editor, and Write
This was the main draw for me. Eliminate all of the things that block me from writing, and just make it easy.

On top of the ease of writing, I can now store my blog in git and push it to GitHub.
