The air was tense as the javascript clock counted down the seconds to 8:00am&#8230;

Three webpages open across dual monitors, Evenbrite in one, Minecon in the other&#8230;

Regular refreshes starting at t-minus 10 seconds&#8230;

Finally&#8230;one second left&#8230;a final refresh.

Nothing.

Refresh again&#8230;

Still, Nothing: &#8220;Batch 1 &#8211; Sold Out&#8221;

Then&#8230;at last&#8230;a qty drop down.

Frantically keying in qty 2&#8230;then, what seemed like hours, as the evenbrite page churned. Humanity barely existing in the fold of time&#8230;epic seconds between death and life. Suddenly, a glimmer of hope.

&#8220;4:59 to complete purchase&#8221;

I was in.
