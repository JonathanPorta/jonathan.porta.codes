As I sit here waiting for my ride, I thought I would offload my pent-up GTA5 Online angst in a blog post. The title of this blog post kept coming to mind.

GTA 5 Online Launches as Government Shuts Down

Coincidence? I think not!

I don&#8217;t really think these two events have anything to do with each other, but in light of such a serious issue, I need to find some humor to cope.

While I spent most of the day working on various shut down related &#8220;things&#8221; &#8211; I wrote this <a href="http://www.ktvq.com/news/federal-government-websites-not-immune-to-shutdown/" target="_blank">article</a>, and <a href="http://www.ktvq.com/news/honor-flight-veterans-break-past-world-war-ii-memorial-barricade/" target="_blank">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.ktvq.com/news/new-candidate-for-u-s-senate/" target="_blank">this one</a> &#8211; it seems that Rockstar had its fair share of bugs to work out:

Hopefully by the time I get home and can download the GTA5 Online update, some of the issues will be fixed. Fingers crossed!
