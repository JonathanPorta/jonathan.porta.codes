It appears that Facebook is rolling out a change requiring all links shared on the social network to include a thumbnail. Presently, the thumbnail is optional.

> *&#8220;Gee, that sure is a swell link you got there about your grandma&#8217;s obituary! Use this cool cat pic as the thumbnail. I found it on your website somewhere.&#8221;*

The change seems to be rolling out gradually and is only effective on a per user basis. I was consistently shown the same version of the post form across several test machines, operating systems and browsers. But, one of my co-workers was somehow switched to use the newer version and this seems to stay the same for him across various platforms.

<div id="attachment_356" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px">
  <a href="/images/posts/2013/11/new-fb-post-form-e1385072997565.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-356 " alt="Screenshot of new Facebook post form." src="/images/posts/2013/11/new-fb-post-form-e1385072997565.jpg" width="600" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    With the new version, you get whatever Facebook feels like picking out for you.
  </p>
</div>

It was not clear whether the changes are related only to Facebook Pages, or if the change affect all link posting. I tested by trying to post the same URL to a Facebook Page of which we are both administrators.

## So, what&#8217;s the problem?

Ah, the reason for writing this post! When posting a link using the old version of the post form there is an option of &#8220;no thumbnail&#8221;. The new form does not include this option.

<div id="attachment_367" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 669px">
  <a href="/images/posts/2013/11/old-fb-form-with-thumbnail-options.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-367" alt="Old Form - Thumbnail and Options" src="/images/posts/2013/11/old-fb-form-with-thumbnail-options.png" width="659" height="361" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    The old version allowed a choice between several thumbnails or post without a thumbnail. Posting directly on Facebook via the status update box included these option plus the ability to upload a custom thumbnail.
  </p>
</div>

If the link you are sharing contains content with a relevant image, Facebook seems to be smart enough to find it. But, when an image exists on the page, and there is no image directly associated with the post content &#8211; think accreditation medals in the site footer or thumbnails of related/recommended posts &#8211; then Facebook seems to grab an image at random. If Facebook doesn&#8217;t find a suitable image on the linked page, it attaches a grey &#8220;no thumbnail&#8221; image to your post.

<div id="attachment_366" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 669px">
  <a href="/images/posts/2013/11/old-fb-form-no-thumbnail.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-366" alt="Old Form - No Thumbnail" src="/images/posts/2013/11/old-fb-form-no-thumbnail.png" width="659" height="321" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    Here is what would happen on the old form when Facebook couldn&#8217;t find an image.
  </p>
</div>

In my opinion, some content simply does not need a thumbnail image. And, with the exception of an exposé on ADHD, no content is helped by an associated image selected at random.

I also noticed that a link shared via a third party plugin, such as AddThis, doesn&#8217;t include the option to cycle through thumbnails or upload a custom thumbnail. Fortunately, pasting the link into the status update box on Facebook affords you these two privileges still.
