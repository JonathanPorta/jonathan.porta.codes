<a title="Google Zerg Rush Easter Egg in action!" href="https://www.google.com/?q=zerg+rush" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43" title="google-zurg-easter-egg" src="/images/posts/2012/04/google-zurg-easter-egg.jpg" alt="Zurg Rush!" width="819" height="472" /></a>

A zerg rush a scenario where low skill units are repeatedly sent after an enemy in an attempt to overwhelm them with shear numbers.

The term originated as a meme from Starcraft and Google created this Easter Egg to honor it. Must be some Starcraft fans at Google!

Starcraft fan anyone?
