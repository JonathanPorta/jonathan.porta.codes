Welcome to a quick rant on bad software.

As a developer, I thrive on solving problems. I love discovering problems, thinking through the code/programming/software/automation solution, and then, sometimes, actually implementing some or all of the solution.

In my job as a developer these are exactly the things I was hired to do. But, in life outside work I constantly find myself annoyed by systems that I feel could be better, or by human-computer interactions that simply fail to meet my mental model of how that interaction should have been.
