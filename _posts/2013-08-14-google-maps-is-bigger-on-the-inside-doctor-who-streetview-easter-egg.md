After somehow ignoring its existence for most of my life, I recently became a huge fan of the BBC&#8217;s Doctor Who. So, naturally, stumbling across this Google Maps Easter egg was cause for celebration.

  <a href="http://jonathanporta.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google-maps-easter-egg-tardis.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-269" alt="Google Maps T.A.R.D.I.S. Easter Egg" src="http://jonathanporta.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google-maps-easter-egg-tardis-e1376468147411.png" width="550" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">

Now, I didn&#8217;t actually stumble across this in Google Maps myself, I saw it on <a title="Techcrunch Doctor Who Google Maps Easter Egg" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/google-maps-doctor-who-tardis-easter-egg/" target="_blank">Techcrunch</a>, but it is still enjoyable nonetheless.

If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, take a look at this <a title="Doctor Who Google Streetview Interior" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ll=51.492132,-0.192862&spn=0.00521,0.009645&sll=51.492140,-0.193028&layer=c&cid=12502927659667388442&panoid=H5FWWz1tdn4AAAQIt7zt5A&cbp=13,283.27,,0,31.62&gl=US&t=m&cbll=51.492159,-0.192966&z=17" target="_blank">Google Streetview link</a>.
